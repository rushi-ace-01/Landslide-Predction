# Landslide Prediction Model
This project focuses on building a robust Landslide Prediction Model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), incorporating data augmentation techniques to enhance model performance and improve predictions.

Key Features: 

Data Preparation:

Utilized a large dataset of historical landslide data in CSV format.
Preprocessed data to ensure compatibility with the CNN model, including normalization and handling missing values.
Model Development:

Designed a CNN architecture tailored for landslide prediction tasks.
Optimized the network with appropriate activation functions, pooling layers, and dropout for better generalization.
Data Augmentation:

Applied data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and scaling to increase data variability and reduce overfitting.
Training and Validation:

Trained the model using augmented data and split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
Monitored metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and loss during training to evaluate model performance.
Evaluation:

Conducted performance analysis using confusion matrices, ROC curves, and other visualization techniques.
Achieved significant improvement in predictive accuracy on unseen data.
Future Work:

Integration of live data streams for real-time predictions.
Deployment as a web application using frameworks like Streamlit for user-friendly accessibility.
